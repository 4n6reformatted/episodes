### How we use these pages

We use these Github Pages as a means to make all our show notes available for our listeners, including any links to articles and relevant content.  We used to include such information in each episode "Description", but we found some of the platforms used to strip out the formatting and make the notes very difficult to read.

We do this for the benefit of the community, so please feel free to leave us a comment or write to us wiith any thoughts, suggestions, or requests.
